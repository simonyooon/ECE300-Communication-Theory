Information theory: entropy, information, channel capacity, rate distortion functions, theoretical limits to data transmission and compression. Error control coding: block, cyclic and convolutional codes, Viterbi algorithm. Baseband and bandpass signals, signal constellations, noise and channel models. Analog and digital modulation formats (amplitude, phase and frequency), MAP and ML receivers, ISI and equalization. Coherent and noncoherent detection, carrier recovery and synchronization. Performance: computation of SNR, BER, power and bandwidth requirements. TDMA,FDMA, CDMA.
